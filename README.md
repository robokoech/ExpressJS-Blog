# Express.js-Blog-Website
This blog style website was created as a way for me to practice using Express.js in collaboration with a MongoDB database. I am able to compose blog posts by either writing within the websites composition portal or by adding to the database directly. The header and footer were created using bootstrap. Click around and Enjoy :)
